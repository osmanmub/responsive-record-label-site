    <h1>Introducing Rydm &amp; Alafia Collective: My First Jam Session</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-neutral-600">15 December 2024 · 3 min read</p>
<p>Welcome to the team, Rydm Jay! We are huge fans of the music you're making. We're young people striving to bring structure to the music industry, empowering young artists to share their talent with the world.</p>

<p>Rydm is truly special. I call him Oba Melody. He masters any beat you give him and seems to make the most of every opportunity. We've been talking for six months now, and I'm consistently impressed by his energy and hunger. He reminds me of a younger me, but he's a thousand times more talented and has the incredible support system of the FRIENDS OF ALAFIA.</p>

<p>His first single, "Okay," is out now, and I'm incredibly excited. You can find it on major DSPs <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/43b45gW3L2w5unxYy1d752?si=bb0967a549044d08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Please give it a listen!</p>

<h2>How My Love for Music Grew</h2>
<p>I'm building Alafia Collective with my team because I genuinely love music. A lot. But I wasn't always this passionate.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wish the story of how I developed my love for music was profound. But like love, growth, and a good song, my story is one of milestones and moments. Here are the key milestones:</p>

<h3>1. I Wasn't Always So Into Music</h3>
<p>In secondary school, I mostly listened to mainstream music downloaded from Waptrick or iroking. Personally, I didn't care to download music myself; I didn't care about much, really. I can still be like this sometimes—unbothered if I can't bring myself to care. "Dadubule" was the most predominant jam, along with some rap songs and maybe 9ice.</p>

<h3>2. Baking with My Big Sis: My First Jam Session</h3>
<p>My big sister, IO—who's actually my cousin, but I call her big sis (my friends who disagree are just hating, seriously)—and I used to listen to music while we baked or cooked. I lived with my aunt, uncle, and cousins for a significant part of my life, and they were a very high-achieving, successful family, so I was always learning from them. I'll write a whole book about IO someday, but for now, all you need to know is that for most of my life, I just wanted to be like her. I modeled my life after hers. She studied Economics and worked at McKinsey, and I was so impressed—she looked so cool, making decks, with a Gantt chart hanging on the door for her baking business.</p>
<p>We used an iPad with a cute pink cover and a strap that allowed it to stand like a small TV. The moment we were in the kitchen, she'd quickly connect Bluetooth. Some of our regulars were Passenger's "Let Her Go," Sam Tsui's "Bring Me the Night," and a lot of Ed Sheeran—I want to say "Don't" or "Thinking Out Loud" was our jam. Birdy's "Skinny Love" was perhaps our favorite, and I knew every line. An honorary shoutout to Flavour (an Igbo woman was always going to be in my future, now that I think back). Her range was insane.</p>
<p>It occurs to me now that baking with her might have been my first JAM SESSION—a sequence of back-to-back bangers and songs that leave you wanting more, where a sing-along is very likely. She was a huge influence in shaping my love for music. I saw my birthday post for her 11 years ago, and it's refreshing to know that I've always wanted to be like her and was obsessed with her. Love you, sis—muah.</p>

<h3>3. It's Coming Together: The Rise of Olamide</h3>
<p>At this point, I started developing a deeper interest in music and fell in love with... drum roll... Olamide Baddoooo. My cousins kindly allowed me to use their iPad, and I'd open YouTube on Safari to watch "Anifowose." Now that I think about it, there was a deep connection to the song lyrics that made me love it so much. This was my first Afro-Adura Jam, and two things stood out:</p>
<ul>
<li>He was talking about seeing his parents alive and well, singing about making sure they got by, all while trying to KEEP HOPE ALIVE ("Mama mi a ni God is able" – Through the hard times, my mom will say God is able).</li>
<li>He said he doesn't want to have to fight, but if they pick on him one more time, he will have to rack.</li>
</ul>
<p>I come from a family of rackers. Back in my day, we were really about that life. At just 14, it meant a lot to listen to someone who sounded like he understood my reality and made music I could deeply connect with.</p>
<p>For the next five years, I listened to only Olamide. I've listened to every song he has ever made that's available on the internet, and even unreleased tracks in videos and on YouTube.</p>
<p>Here is a line I like from "Anifowose":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oga Ade (popular term used to refer to an individual or regular man)<br />
Ewo ibi ta ba de (look how far we have made it)<br />
Omo eru doba (the son of the slave, or people who have been looked down upon, has become King)<br />
Igboro demilade (the streets have crowned me)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has heavily influenced my love for Afro-Adura, songs that are like a prayer in Yoruba. They sound like you're one-on-one with God, crying to him. For me, someone who is constantly crying to God, Olamide and the world of songs about hope, prayers, and thanksgiving resonate deeply.</p>

<h2>The Journey into the Music Industry</h2>

<h3>4. Thank You for Believing in Me, Steph (2019-2020)</h3>
<p>Stephanie and I went to university together. She is very, very passionate about art. She is an artist and rapper first, and this year she is dropping new music. In addition, she is currently building Kenya's first art district and also managing Kenyan sensation Lil Maina, who had an amazing run in 2024—stay tuned!</p>
<p>Steph and I have built a wonderful friendship over the years, from watching to jam sessions in Uni where people were rapping on a beat on a random evening outside Piment Banane. For some reason, she was convinced I would do a good job managing her alongside a friend. With the right amount of belief and a support system, you can do anything. I had no clue what I was doing, but ALU was teaching us that you can use frameworks for anything in life. This is sometimes true. It was not then. I did not last in this job as I was out of my depth, but here is a cute post from my time as manager when she dropped. Thank you for believing in me, Steph!</p>

<h3>5. Jay and Temitope (2019-Forever)</h3>
<p>The year is 2019, and my friend Julian Mason told me there was an opportunity to work on a project with a big artist where they needed decks, proposals, and rollout support. Julian and I have a very similar approach: it doesn't matter what the opportunity or work is, if you can pay the right amount, we can run it. It helps that we are two smart, resilient people, so we always figure it out, à la Batman and Robin. We worked on this project for a couple of months, and this was my first proper introduction to the back-end of the music industry.</p>
<p>Jay also managed Trill Xoe; he saw the gem-in-the-rough very early, in 2016. We all went to Uni together, but he was already a music head, so it was much easier for them to connect and start building things. Jay and Trill were key to organizing the best and biggest parties in the University. They also facilitated a show with Davido, Mayorkun, and Kiddominant. The boys were already doing some amazing stuff around 2018-2021.</p>
<p>We have a podcast/radio show with our darling Mfon—we only released four episodes, but go and hear the quality of the production. Trill was in charge of everything as well as being a crew member, and we created some magic in 2019. Check out The Cruise Talk Episode.</p>

<h3>6. Trill Xoe, Mofe, and Temitope (2019-Forever)</h3>
<p>Jay and I lived ten minutes from each other, so we always hung out. He tried to get me to be his gym buddy, but that didn't stick. What did stick was Trill's music. When Trill left, he handed over to Mofe Jemide, or as I like to call him, MANAGERRR.</p>
<p>This was when, in 2019, I reconnected with the hardest producer in the world, Trill Xoe. At this point, music was in my blood, and I had a decent understanding of the ropes; he took a chance on me. I just kept showing up every time. I remember Trill saying, "Omo mehn, I appreciate you coming all the way." It was never that far, but Trill appreciates family. I pitched myself every time I saw him and kept giving them ideas.</p>
<p>At some point, Mofe and Trill were tired of my pitching and said, "Come join the team." I very happily agreed. Mofe and Trill, thank you for taking a chance. Trill produced the song Arsenal Football Club used to announce Declan Rice—crazyyy!</p>
<p>Trill has gone on to do some amazing things solely off the talent God gave him. And, trust me, he's not done. The world hasn't heard 10% of what this man can do. I am so grateful for all the music I get to listen to on the back end. He has dropped his second project, "Damage Control 2"—it's spazzing.</p>

<h2>Welcome to the Team, Rydm Jay!</h2>
<p>Again... so, welcome to the team, RYDM Jay. You are in good and passionate hands; my team and I are relentlessly committed to your success. Visit <a href="https://alafiacollective.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alafiacollective.com</a> or follow us on Instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/alafia.collective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alafia.collective</a> (other platforms are coming, I promise).</p>
<p>For someone who is used to frameworks, it's funny to see that in certain situations, I leave it to God and serendipity to bring the right person at the right time. This process has birthed our latest sensation—RYDM Jay.</p>
<p>Rydm's music sometimes feels like a heartfelt prayer to God. "Okay" echoes the themes of Olamide's "Anifowoshe," focusing on the deep desire to ensure your family is okay. It reflects the lengths we go to protect and provide for our loved ones, embodying the universal struggle of responsibility and hope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If family don chop i dey okay (If my family has eaten then I am okay)<br />
Don’t care if my enemies screaming mogbe (I am not concerned with the troubles that have befallen my enemies)<br />
Congratulations Oluwa lo shey (Congratulations, to me, it was God that did it)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a review from Tomi, who is also an artist and all-around creative (stay tuned!). <a href="https://motitomi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motitomi</a>—her brainchild—captures her creative endeavors. She is my Notion girlie, and her masterclass helped me build out our operations department on Notion.</p>
<p>Welcome, Rydm Jay, you are in good hands—let the party begin!</p>
<p>I want to say thank you to all my friends, family, and loved ones who have supported me. I stand on the shoulders of all the people who love me, sacrifice for me, fight for my best interests every time, and hold me together with hugs.</p>
<p>Have a nice one and take care of the baddies!</p>
