    <h1>Introducing Rydm &amp; Alafia Collective: My First Jam Session</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-neutral-600">15 December 2024 · 5 min read</p>

    <p>Welcome to the team, Rydm Jay! We are huge fans of the music you're making. We're young people striving to bring structure to the music industry, empowering young artists to share their talent with the world.</p>

    <p>Rydm is truly special. I call him Oba Melody. He masters any beat you give him and seems to make the most of every opportunity. We've been talking for six months now, and I'm consistently impressed by his energy and hunger. He reminds me of a younger me, but he's a thousand times more talented and has the incredible support system of the FRIENDS OF ALAFIA.</p>

    <p>His first single, <strong>"Okay,"</strong> is out now, and I'm incredibly excited. You can find it on major DSPs here. Please give it a listen!</p>

    <h2>How My Love for Music Grew</h2>
    <p>I'm building Alafia Collective with my team because I genuinely love music. A lot. But I wasn't always this passionate.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, I wish the story of how I developed my love for music was profound. But like love, growth and a good song, my story is one of milestones and moments. Here are the key milestones:</p>

    <h3>1. I Wasn't Always So Into Music</h3>
    <p>In secondary school, I mostly listened to mainstream music downloaded from Waptrick or iroking. Personally, I didn't care to download music myself; I didn't care about much, really. I can still be like this sometimes—unbothered if I can't bring myself to care. "Dadubule" was the most predominant jam, along with some rap songs and maybe 9ice.</p>

    <h3>2. Baking with My Big Sis: My First Jam Session</h3>
    <p>My big sister, IO—who's actually my cousin, but I call her big sis (my friends who disagree are just hating, seriously)—and I used to listen to music while we baked or cooked. I lived with my aunt, uncle and cousins for a significant part of my life, and they were a very high‑achieving family, so I was always learning from them. I'll write a whole book about IO someday, but for now, all you need to know is that for most of my life, I just wanted to be like her.</p>

    <p>We used an iPad with a cute pink cover and a strap that allowed it to stand like a small TV. The moment we were in the kitchen, she'd quickly connect Bluetooth. Some of our regulars were Passenger's "Let Her Go," Sam Tsui's "Bring Me the Night," and plenty of Ed Sheeran—"Don't" or "Thinking Out Loud" was our jam. Birdy's "Skinny Love" was perhaps our favorite, and I knew every line. An honorary shout‑out to Flavour—her range was insane.</p>

    <p>It occurs to me now that baking with her might have been my first <strong>jam session</strong>—a sequence of back‑to‑back bangers and songs that leave you wanting more. She shaped my love for music. Love you, sis—muah.</p>

    <h3>3. It's Coming Together: The Rise of Olamide</h3>
    <p>At this point, I started developing a deeper interest in music and fell in love with... drum roll... Olamide Baddo. My cousins kindly allowed me to use their iPad, and I'd open YouTube on Safari to watch "Anifowose." There was a deep connection to the song lyrics that made me love it so much. This was my first Afro‑Adura jam, and two things stood out:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>He was talking about seeing his parents alive and well, singing about making sure they got by, all while trying to keep hope alive ("Mama mi a ni God is able").</li>
      <li>He said he doesn't want to have to fight, but if they pick on him one more time, he will have to rack.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I come from a family of rackers. Back in my day, we were really about that life. At just 14, it meant a lot to listen to someone who understood my reality and made music I could deeply connect with.</p>

    <p>For the next five years I listened only to Olamide. I've heard every song he's released online and even unreleased tracks floating around on YouTube.</p>

    <p>Here is a line I like from "Anifowose":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oga Ade – look how far we have made it</li>
      <li>Omo eru doba – the son of a slave has become king</li>
      <li>Igboro demilade – the streets have crowned me</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Heavily influenced by Afro‑Adura, I gravitate toward songs that feel like a prayer in Yoruba—one‑on‑one with God, crying out. Olamide's world of hope, prayers and thanksgiving resonates deeply.</p>

    <h2>The Journey into the Music Industry</h2>
    <h3>4. Thank You for Believing in Me, Steph (2019‑2020)</h3>
    <p>Stephanie and I went to university together. She is very passionate about art and is dropping new music this year. She's also building Kenya's first art district and managing Kenyan sensation Lil Maina, who had an amazing run in 2024.</p>

    <p>We built a wonderful friendship over the years, bonding at jam sessions where people rapped on random evenings outside Piment Banane. She convinced me I'd be a good manager. With the right amount of belief and a support system, you can do anything. I had no clue what I was doing, but ALU taught us you can use frameworks for anything in life. It was not then. I didn't last long in the job—thank you for believing in me, Steph!</p>

    <h3>5. Jay and Temitope (2019‑Forever)</h3>
    <p>The year is 2019 and my friend Julian Mason told me about an opportunity to work on a project with a big artist who needed decks, proposals and rollout support. Julian and I are very similar: if the pay is right, we can run it. We're two smart, resilient people, so we always figure it out—à la Batman and Robin. That project was my first proper introduction to the back‑end of the music industry.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Industry and Music Business</h3>
    <p>Jay also managed Trill Xoe and saw the gem in the rough early on. Together they threw the best parties at university and even facilitated a show with Davido, Mayorkun and Kiddominant. The boys were already doing amazing things around 2018‑2021.</p>

    <p>We have a podcast and radio show with our darling Mfon—we only released four episodes, but the production quality was stellar. Trill handled everything while also being a crew member. Check out The Cruise Talk Episode.</p>

    <h3>6. Trill Xoe, Mofe and Temitope (2019‑Forever)</h3>
    <p>Jay and I lived ten minutes from each other, so we always hung out. He tried to get me to be his gym buddy, but that didn't stick. What did stick was Trill's music. When Trill left, he handed over management duties to Mofe Jemide—MANAGERRR.</p>

    <p>In 2019 I reconnected with Trill, the hardest producer in the world. Music was in my blood and I had a decent understanding of the ropes, so he took a chance on me. I kept showing up. At some point Mofe and Trill were tired of my pitches and said, "Come join the team." I was ecstatic. Trill produced the song Arsenal used to announce Declan Rice—crazy!</p>

    <p>Trill has gone on to do amazing things solely off the talent God gave him. And trust me, he's not done. The world hasn't heard ten percent of what this man can do. I'm grateful for all the music I hear behind the scenes. He's dropped his second project, "Damage Control 2"—it's spazzing.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to the Team, Rydm Jay!</h2>
    <p>So, welcome to the team, Rydm Jay. You're in good and passionate hands; my team and I are relentlessly committed to your success. Visit alafiacollective.com or follow us on Instagram at <strong>alafia.collective</strong>—other platforms coming soon.</p>

    <p>For someone used to frameworks, it's funny that in certain situations I leave it to God and serendipity to bring the right person at the right time. This process birthed our latest sensation—RYDM Jay.</p>

    <p>Rydm's music sometimes feels like a heartfelt prayer to God. "Okay" echoes the themes of Olamide's "Anifowoshe," focusing on the deep desire to ensure your family is okay. It reflects the lengths we go to protect and provide for loved ones, embodying the universal struggle of responsibility and hope.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If family don chop I dey okay – if my family has eaten then I am okay</li>
      <li>Don’t care if my enemies screaming mogbe – I'm not concerned with the troubles that have befallen my enemies</li>
      <li>Congratulations Oluwa lo shey – congratulations, it was God that did it</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's a review from Tomi—artist and all‑round creative. Her Motitomi masterclass helped me build out our operations on Notion.</p>

    <p>Welcome, Rydm Jay, you're in good hands—let the party begin!</p>

    <p>I want to say thank you to all my friends, family and loved ones who have supported me. I stand on the shoulders of everyone who loves me, sacrifices for me, fights for my best interests and holds me together with hugs.</p>

    <p>Have a nice one and take care of the baddies!</p>
