    <h1>From Consulting to the Alafia Collective</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-neutral-600">20 January 2025 · 2 min read</p>
    <p>Hello! At one point in life, I was convinced I wanted to become a managing partner at a consulting firm; ten years later, I’m running a record label with my bestie from university. After the blood, sweat, and tears, I’d like to present to you Alafia Collective. In one line, our vision is to power Africa’s next generation of global icons.</p>
    <p>In 2019, I was using sparkline formulas to create automated timelines and Gantt charts for artists and their teams.</p>
    <p>In 2020, Trill Xoe, one of Nigeria’s finest producers, gave me the opportunity to be his full-time manager. In that time, Trillo became the most sought-after producer, crafting the number-one song in the country. The song, “Declan Rice,” went on to become the official announcement track for England and Arsenal star Declan Rice.</p>
    <p>By 2023, Mubarak Osman, Julian Mason, and I crystallised what we call the Paradox of Access: creating and distributing music is easier than ever, but breaking through the clutter is harder than ever.</p>
    <p>Alafia Collective provides integrated management, label services, and publishing solutions that elevate African talent into global powerhouses. Currently, our roster boasts Billboard-charting producer EJ FYA (“Talibans” – Byron Messia ft. Burna Boy), Kenya’s pop sensation Nikita Kering’, Rydm (new Starboy), Mide the Goat, and Saezn (Africa’s R&B sensation).</p>
    <p>Kindly check out our website <a href="https://alafia.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alafia.me</a>. I would love to chat with people in the music, entertainment, and PR spaces – I need visibility for my artists!</p>
    <p>My label act drops new music in two days—music like you’ve never heard before. Some call me the Pep Guardiola of music, and I’m happy to share the gems we’ve been cooking with interested parties.</p>
