    <h1>Gospel Artists With A Popstar Calling</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-neutral-600">20 June 2025 · 6 min read</p>
<p>One of my favourite things happening right now is the rise of young people making music who are deeply in touch with their spirituality.</p>
<p>When they make music, you can hear the deep yearning for a better life, a plea for divine intervention. Songs like <em>Jesus Christ 2</em>, <em>Salt</em> and <em>Bullion Van</em> come to mind.</p>
<p>This article focuses on Black Sherif and how his music has inspired me over the years.</p>
<p>When I heard <em>Jesus Christ 2</em>, it proved music speaks to the spirit. Even without understanding the language, I felt the connection to two artists begging God and fighting the odds.</p>
<p>Black Sherif sings with heart and addresses real-life struggles. His themes of hope, love, grace and resilience resonate deeply.</p>
<p>Recently he said, “Imagine what it means to be a gospel artist with a pop-star calling.” Three songs that exemplify this are <em>Lord, I’m Amazed</em>, <em>Jesus Christ</em> with AratheJay and <em>Oil on My Head</em>.</p>
<h2>Oil on My Head</h2>
<p>The song declares that the grace of God is upon him and it is impossible for him to fail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil on my head, everything I touch is blessing<br>
All I see is blessings and no man can stop me<br>
Send them my way, evil eyes don’t watch me<br>
’Cos all I see is blessings and no one can stop me</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Themes of Resilience</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh lord I won’t stop for nothing<br>
Victory is near I am feeling it<br>
Man don’t stay down when man fall<br>
Get up and come for more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lines like these could fit into any faith declaration. The conviction in his delivery shows that everything he touches turns to gold because of the oil on his head.</p>
<p>There are consistent themes of refusing to give up—“Don’t stop o my Jiggy Blacko … Kweku the black sheep no dey give up.”</p>
<p>At my lowest moments, when I have no motivation, I turn to Black Sherif because he gets me.</p>
<h2>Lord, I’m Amazed</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m full of love, can’t see on the telly<br>
Son of the Sun, I’m never unlucky<br>
It’s written and bound to happen; it’s certain<br>
So my cherie coco, why worry, why worry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reminds himself who he is—the son of the sun. I am never unlucky. It’s as if God gave him these lyrics.</p>
<p>The line “So my Cherie Coco, why worry?” really hits home. If you know God, why worry?</p>
<p>Blacko says don’t worry—God has it sorted. Keep going, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep going, mɛmpoli Jack<br>
I say some grace for you<br>
Pick yourself off the floor<br>
You design, God ensures</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His music is real and grounded, acknowledging that life is tough but grace abounds.</p>
<p>We can plan, but ultimately it is God who makes things happen. As digital entrepreneurs say, “You fit roll dice but na God dey throw double 6.”</p>
<h2>Acknowledging A Higher Power</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many man carry fire, chasing me, racing me, disturbing me<br>
They said I was done make I retire<br>
But I’m blazing, they no wan believe<br>
And I can’t pretend something dey cover me oh<br>
Blessings dey follow me oh<br>
Yes me and my amigos</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He knows favour has gone ahead of him, so no matter the opposition he will overcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I want to say, stand well if you come for me o<br>
Oil in my head, my body and soul<br>
Yes, me I’m stacking my doe oh like Kilimanjaro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confidence oozes from these lines—you better be prepared if you come for him.</p>
<p>I have new music out from my label act Rydm; you can stream it here. It’s been a journey, but LORD I’M AMAZED.</p>
<p>Here is an Afro-Adura playlist for you, and as usual have a nice one and take care of the baddies!</p>
