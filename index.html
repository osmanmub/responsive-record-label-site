        <h1>What is IDK?</h1>
          <p class="home-bio">
            IDK is more than what your girl says when you ask her what she wants to eat. It's a lifestyle.
            It's a brand. It's a movement. But most importantly, it's the name of this record label. Here at
            IDK, we don't know what we're doing most of the time. But we're doing it. And that's all that matters.
            <em>Whoa that song was fire, do you know who made that?</em>&nbsp;<strong>IDK.</strong> <em>I really need someone
            to make a dope beat for me. Do you know anyone?</em>&nbsp;<strong>IDK.</strong> <em>I'm trying to go to a
            concert. Know any good acts?</em>&nbsp;<strong>IDK!</strong> The answer is always IDK.
