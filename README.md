# Record Label Website

A simple multi-page site for an imaginary record label. The design uses a minimal dark theme and is fully responsive.

## Pages
- **Home** – introduction to the label
- **Artists** – roster of artists
- **Events** – upcoming shows and events
- **Playlists** – curated playlists
- **Blog** – news updates
- **Merch** – basic store layout

All pages share a consistent header, footer, and layout. Images and text are placeholders that can be replaced with real content.
