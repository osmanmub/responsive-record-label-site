# Responsive Website
A simple responsive website for an imaginary record label.

## About
[This website](https://taylorbotts.github.io/responsive-record-label-site/) was a project on responsive design. Using CSS grid and media queries the website's four pages will display differently when viewed on desktop versus mobile without losing any information.

## Publishing your changes
1. Commit your edits with a descriptive message.
2. Push to the branch used for hosting (for GitHub Pages this is typically `gh-pages` or `main`).
3. If you use a custom domain, create a `CNAME` file in the repository root containing only your domain name.
4. Updates can take a few minutes to propagate. If you do not see the new version right away, try doing a hard refresh or clearing your browser's cache.
